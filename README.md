Hello! My name is Marco Khodr and I am striving to become a professional programmer!
I love everything about computers and it mean so much to be able what I love as a
career so have taken the intiative to make some of my own apps and projects while
I am still in school to showcase my skills so I have the best shot at achieving my
dream. Me and a couple of my classmates created Codex a school project for the
UofA Coding Bootcamp. Its goal was to be a reliable, UI friendly coding tool
to help beginners get started. Codex's main feature is allowing the user to
code and watch videos on the same page and as well as saving the video and
code into tabs that the user can easily access again. Other features include
quizzes and tests for the user to test themselves on and will even show the most
relevent events or meetups that are nearby the user.



After graduating the bootcamp,
I decided to redo the entire app from scratch myself so not only will I be able
to remember what I learned in the bootcamp but I also was able to finish it with
a lot more readable code and even was able to fix most  of the bugs from the original.
